## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to explore whether machine learning models can accurately classify emotional and mental health states from short texts. We compare several models and aim to identify the most effective one for predicting mental health conditions.

## 📝 Introduction

Early identification of mental health conditions is essential for timely intervention and support. This project focuses on classifying text statements into mental health categories (e.g., Depression, Normal, Suicidal) using various machine learning and deep learning models. The best performing model was **Distil-BERT** with an accuracy of **79.3%**.
